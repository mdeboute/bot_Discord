# Mr Larbin 🤖

![alt text](https://github.com/mdeboute/bot_Discord/blob/main/assets/larbin.jpg)

A bot written with Discord.py wich can stream music, do a search on WolframAlpha, generate memes, and do lots of other cool things ! Use the `!help` command to get a list of commands !

## Additional Dependencies ⚠️

Python dependencies are denoted in `requirements.txt` (to allow for streaming of media, make sure `opus` and `ffmpeg` are installed)

## Configuring 🔧

When you run the bot for the first time, a default configuration file will be generated called `config.toml`. You can enter that file to change certain parameters.

If you ever wish to restore the bot to default configuration, you can simply delete (or rename) your config file. A new one will be generated upon startup.

Add your token in the function `run_client` of the file `bot.py`.
